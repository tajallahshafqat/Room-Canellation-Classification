# Room-Canellation-Classification
# Introduction
This Jupyter notebook aims to perform a binary classification task to predict room cancellations in a hotel dataset. The analysis utilizes Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation, Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and scikit-learn for applying multiple machine learning models.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including features such as arrival date, number of guests, and special requests. The target variable is 'is_canceled,' indicating whether a booking was canceled (1) or not (0).

The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of room cancellation prediction using various machine learning models. The final results, including model accuracies and visualizations, will assist in selecting the best-performing model for the given dataset.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the notebook for your specific needs.
